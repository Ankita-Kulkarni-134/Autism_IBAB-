# Autism_IBAB

This repository aims to build machine learning models to predict Autism using copy number variation (CNV) calls from genomic samples. It covers the full workflow from genome analysis to predictive modeling, integrating bioinformatics and machine learning techniques to uncover genomic patterns associated with Autism.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

To leverage CNV data derived from individuals with Autism to build robust machine learning models for predictive diagnosis. This project integrates bioinformatics workflows (e.g., FASTQ and BAM processing, variant calling) with classical machine learning techniques (e.g., linear/logistic regression) for pattern recognition and classification.
